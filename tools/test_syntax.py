"""The syntax card: Python's message, said so a beginner can fix it.

    python3 tools/test_syntax.py

When a student presses Run the page asks Python, before running anything,
whether it can read the program (_pyide_check in runtime.js). If not, a card
over the editor says what is wrong in plain words (syntax.js), with Python's
own message under it.

WHAT IS ACTUALLY BEING GUARDED

  The words match the Python students really have.
      Every sentence is chosen by matching Python's message, and Python
      rewords its messages between versions. So the mistakes below are run
      through THE Pyodide the browser loads (node_modules/pyodide), and each
      must get its own sentence. A Pyodide upgrade that rewords one fails
      here rather than showing a class the vague fallback.

  Every rule still fires.
      A rule no real message matches any more is dead weight that looks like
      coverage. Each one must be hit by at least one mistake below.

  Syntax only.
      The check compiles and never runs, so a program that reads fine — even
      one that is wrong, or would crash — gets no card, and nothing in it is
      executed by the check.

  Both pages check before they run.
      The editor and the class's live page, before a game loads or anything
      is pushed into Python.
