"""Tab and Backspace land on tab stops, and only inside the indentation.

    python3 tools/test_tabstops.py

WHY THIS IS TESTED AND NOT JUST EYEBALLED

Indentation in Python is syntax, so an off-by-one here is not a cosmetic
bug — it is an IndentationError, or worse, a line that quietly joins the
wrong block and runs. A student who presses Backspace three times instead
of four gets a program that looks right on screen and behaves differently,
which is the hardest kind of mistake to find at fourteen.

And the ways of getting this wrong are all invisible in a screenshot:

  * Backspace eating four characters of a WORD rather than of an indent
  * a stop computed from cm.getCursor().ch while a pasted literal tab makes
    the column and the character offset different numbers
  * Tab moving a fixed four from column 2, so the file is still misaligned
    and now nobody can see by how much

The two handlers are pulled out of the shipped app.js and run here against
a small stand-in editor. Retyping them would be testing a copy that happens
to agree with the original today.
